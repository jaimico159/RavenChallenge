This project allows you to search GitHub users by login using your own GitHub Graphql Api Token

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to get a copy of the project up and running on you local machine for testing purposes.



### Prerequisites

For Running this app you need npm, installing Node.js is recommended because npm is distributed with Node.js, [here is a link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for installing Node.js.

Also you need to generate a token from the GitHub GraphQL API, this is essential for querying in GitHub.

Running this React App doesn't handle any type of backend, according to the [React Web Page](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) "it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want".
